What's new in version 0.6.2

* BUGFIX: Fixed crash when using some .htoprc files from 0.6
  (thanks to Wolfram Schlich and John Thomas for the reports)

What's new in version 0.6.1

  to the number of CPUs present in the machine. Note that
  because of this, older versions of htop may crash when
  using an .htoprc file modified my the newer version.
* Accept --with-proc=<dir> in configure, to specify
  alternative procfs locations (making htop friendlier
  to the Linux compatibility layer in FreeBSD)

  (thanks to Peter Hyman)
* Added a check to make sure that a root-user htop closes
  when its parent non-root terminal is closed.
  (thanks to Ilya Evseev for the report)
