htop \- interactive process viewer
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP 
.B htop [\fI\-dChusv\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
Htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for Linux.
.LP
It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally,
so you can see all the processes running on the system, along with their full
command lines.
.LP
Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without
entering their PIDs.
.br 
.SH "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS"
.LP
Mandatory arguments to long options are madatory for short options too.
.LP 
.TP
\fB\-d \-\-delay=DELAY\fR
Delay between updates, in tenths of seconds
.TP
\fB\-C \-\-no-color \-\-no-colour\fR
Start htop in monochrome mode
.TP
\fB\-h \-\-help
Display a help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-p \-\-pid=PID,PID...\fR
Show only the given PIDs
.TP
\fB\-s \-\-sort\-key COLUMN\fR
Sort by this column (use \-\-sort\-key help for a column list)
.TP
\fB\-u \-\-user=USERNAME\fR
Show only the processes of a given user
.TP
\fB\-v \-\-version

.PP

.SH "INTERACTIVE COMMANDS"
.LP 
The following commands are supported while in htop:
.LP 
.TP 5
.B Arrows, PgUP, PgDn, Home, End
Scroll the process list.
.TP
.B Space
Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple processes,
like "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged processes, instead
of the currently highlighted one.
.TP
.B U
Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space key).
.TP
.B s
Trace process system calls: if strace(1) is installed, pressing this key
will attach it to the currently selected process, presenting a live
update of system calls issued by the process.
.TP
.B l
Display open files for a process: if lsof(1) is installed, pressing this key
will display the list of file descriptors opened by the process.
.TP
.B F1, h, ?
Go to the help screen
.TP
.B F2, S
Go to the setup screen, where you can configure the meters displayed at the top
of the screen, set various display options, choose among color schemes, and
select which columns are displayed, in which order.
.TP
.B F3, /
Incrementally search the command lines of all the displayed processes. The
currently selected (highlighted) command will update as you type. While in
search mode, pressing F3 will cycle through matching occurrences.
.TP
.B F4, \\\\
Incremental process filtering: type in part of a process command line and
only processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel filtering,
enter the Filter option again and press Esc.
.TP
.B F5, t
Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the relations
between them as a tree. Toggling the key will switch between tree and
your previously selected sort view. Selecting a sort view will exit
tree view.
.TP
.B F6, <, >
Select a field for sorting. The current sort field is indicated by a
highlight in the header.
.TP
.B F7, ]
Increase the selected process's priority (subtract from 'nice' value).
This can only be done by the superuser.
.TP
.B F8, [
Decrease the selected process's priority (add to 'nice' value)
.TP
.B F9, k
"Kill" process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one or a group
of processes. If processes were tagged, sends the signal to all tagged processes.
If none is tagged, sends to the currently selected process.
.TP
.B F10, q
Quit
.TP
.B I
Invert the sort order: if sort order is increasing, switch to decreasing, and
vice-versa.
.TP
.B +, \- 
When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree is collapsed
a "+" sign shows to the left of the process name.
.TP
.B a (on multiprocessor machines)
Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use.
.TP
.B u
Show only processes owned by a specified user.
.TP
.B M
Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B P
Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B T
Sort by time (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B F
"Follow" process: if the sort order causes the currently selected process
to move in the list, make the selection bar follow it. This is useful for
monitoring a process: this way, you can keep a process always visible on
screen. When a movement key is used, "follow" loses effect.
.TP
.B K
Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel to be
displayed in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B H
Hide user threads: on systems that represent them differently than ordinary
processes (such as recent NPTL-based systems), this can hide threads from
userspace processes in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B Ctrl-L
Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.
.TP
.B Numbers
PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight will be moved to it.
.PD

.SH "COLUMNS"
.LP 
The following columns can display data about each process. A value of '\-' in
all the rows indicates that a column is unsupported on your system, or
currently unimplemented in htop. The names below are the ones used in the
"Available Columns" section of the setup screen. If a different name is
shown in htop's main screen, it is shown below in parenthesis.
