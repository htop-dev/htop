htop \- interactive process viewer
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP
.B htop
.RB [ \-dCFhpustv ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
.B htop
is a cross-platform ncurses-based process viewer.
.LP
It is similar to
.BR top ,
but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, and interact using
a pointing device (mouse).
You can observe all processes running on the system, along with their
command line arguments, as well as view them in a tree format, select
multiple processes and acting on them all at once.
.LP
Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without
entering their PIDs.
.br
.SH "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS"
.LP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.LP
.TP
\fB\-d \-\-delay=DELAY\fR

.SH "INTERACTIVE COMMANDS"
.LP
The following commands are supported while in
.BR htop :
.LP
.TP 5
.B Up, Alt-k
Select (highlight) the previous process in the process list. Scroll the list
if necessary.
.TP
.B Down, Alt-j
Select (highlight) the next process in the process list. Scroll the list if
necessary.
.TP
.B Left, Alt-h
Scroll the process list left.
.TP
.B Right, Alt-l
Scroll the process list right.
.TP
.B PgUp, PgDn
Scroll the process list up or down one window.
.TP
.B Home
Scroll to the top of the process list and select the first process.
.TP
.B End
Scroll to the bottom of the process list and select the last process.
.TP
.B Ctrl-A, ^
Scroll left to the beginning of the process entry (i.e. beginning of line).
.TP
.B Ctrl-E, $
Scroll right to the end of the process entry (i.e. end of line).
.TP
.B Space
Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple processes,
like "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged processes, instead
of the currently highlighted one.
.TP
.B c
Tag the current process and its children. Commands that can operate on multiple
processes, like "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged processes,
instead of the currently highlighted one.
.TP
.B U
Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space or c keys).
.TP
.B s
Trace process system calls: if strace(1) is installed, pressing this key
will attach it to the currently selected process, presenting a live
update of system calls issued by the process.
.TP
.B l
Display open files for a process: if lsof(1) is installed, pressing this key
will display the list of file descriptors opened by the process.
.TP
.B M
Display the command line of the highlighted process in multiple lines.
.TP
.B F1, h, ?
Go to the help screen
.TP
.B F2, S
Go to the setup screen, where you can configure the meters displayed at the top
of the screen, set various display options, choose among color schemes, and
select which columns are displayed, in which order.
.TP
.B F3, /
Incrementally search the command lines of all the displayed processes. The
currently selected (highlighted) command will update as you type. While in
search mode, pressing F3 will cycle through matching occurrences.
.TP
.B F4, \\\\
Incremental process filtering: type in part of a process command line and
only processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel filtering,
enter the Filter option again and press Esc.
.TP
.B F5, t
Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the relations
between them as a tree. Toggling the key will switch between tree and
your previously selected sort view. Selecting a sort view will exit
tree view.
.TP
.B F6
On sorted view, select a field for sorting, also accessible through < and >.
The current sort field is indicated by a highlight in the header.
On tree view, expand or collapse the current subtree. A "+" indicator in the
tree node indicates that it is collapsed.
.TP
.B F7, ]
Increase the selected process's priority (subtract from 'nice' value).
This can only be done by the superuser.
.TP
.B F8, [
Decrease the selected process's priority (add to 'nice' value)
.TP
.B F9, k
"Kill" process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one or a group
of processes. If processes were tagged, sends the signal to all tagged processes.
If none is tagged, sends to the currently selected process.
.TP
.B F10, q
Quit
.TP
.B I
Invert the sort order: if sort order is increasing, switch to decreasing, and
vice-versa.
.TP
.B +, \-
When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree is collapsed
a "+" sign shows to the left of the process name.
.TP
.B a (on multiprocessor machines)
Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use.
.TP
.B u
Show only processes owned by a specified user.
.TP
.B M
Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B P
Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B T
Sort by time (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B F
"Follow" process: if the sort order causes the currently selected process
to move in the list, make the selection bar follow it. This is useful for
monitoring a process: this way, you can keep a process always visible on
screen. When a movement key is used, "follow" loses effect.
.TP
.B K
Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel to be
displayed in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B H
Hide user threads: on systems that represent them differently than ordinary
processes (such as recent NPTL-based systems), this can hide threads from
userspace processes in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B p
Show full paths to running programs, where applicable. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B Ctrl-L
Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.
.TP
.B Numbers
PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight will be moved to it.
.PD
.SH "COLUMNS"

all the rows indicates that a column is unsupported on your system, or
currently unimplemented in
.BR htop .

.SH "CONFIG FILE"
.LP
By default
.B htop
reads its configuration from the XDG-compliant path
.IR ~/.config/htop/htoprc .
The configuration file is overwritten by
.BR htop 's
in-program Setup configuration, so it should not be hand-edited.
If no user configuration exists
.B htop
tries to read the system-wide configuration from
.I @sysconfdir@/htoprc
and as a last resort, falls back to its hard coded defaults.
.LP
You may override the location of the configuration file using the $HTOPRC
environment variable (so you can have multiple configurations for different
machines that share the same home directory, for example).
.SH "MEMORY SIZES"
.LP
Memory sizes in
.B htop
are displayed in a human-readable form.
Sizes are printed in powers of 1024. (e.g., 1023M = 1072693248 Bytes)
.LP
The decision to use this convention was made in order to conserve screen
space and make memory size representations consistent throughout
.BR htop .
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.BR top (1),
.BR free (1),
.BR ps (1),
.BR uptime (1)
