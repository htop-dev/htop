.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B htop
is a cross-platform ncurses-based process viewer.
.LP
It is similar to
.BR top ,
but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, and interact using
a pointing device (mouse).
You can observe all processes running on the system, along with their
command line arguments, as well as view them in a tree format, select
multiple processes and act on them all at once.
.LP
Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without
entering their PIDs.
.LP
.B pcp-htop
is a version of
.B htop
built using the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Metrics API (see \c
.BR PCPIntro (1),
.BR PMAPI (3)),
allowing to extend
.B htop
to display values from arbitrary metrics.
See the section below titled
.B "CONFIG FILES"
for further details.
.br
.SH "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS"
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-d \-\-delay=DELAY\fR
Delay between updates, in tenths of a second. If the delay value is
less than 1, it is increased to 1, i.e. 1/10 second. If the delay value
is greater than 100, it is decreased to 100, i.e. 10 seconds.
.TP
\fB\-C \-\-no-color \-\-no-colour\fR
Start
.B htop
in monochrome mode

.br
Drop unneeded Linux capabilities.
In strict mode features like killing, changing process priorities, and reading
process delay accounting information will not work, due to less capabilities
held.
.SH "INTERACTIVE COMMANDS"
The following commands are supported while in
.BR htop :

Select the next / the previous screen tab to display.
You can enable showing the screen tab names in the Setup screen (F2).
.TP
.B Up, Alt-k
Select (highlight) the previous process in the process list. Scroll the list
if necessary.
.TP
.B Down, Alt-j
Select (highlight) the next process in the process list. Scroll the list if
necessary.
.TP
.B Left, Alt-h
Scroll the process list left.
.TP
.B Right, Alt-l

.TP
.B Ctrl-A, ^
Scroll left to the beginning of the process entry (i.e. beginning of line).
.TP
.B Ctrl-E, $
Scroll right to the end of the process entry (i.e. end of line).
.TP
.B Space
Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple processes,
like "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged processes, instead
of the currently highlighted one.
.TP
.B c
Tag the current process and its children. Commands that can operate on multiple
processes, like "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged processes,
instead of the currently highlighted one.
.TP
.B U
Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space or c keys).
.TP
.B s
Trace process system calls: if strace(1) is installed, pressing this key
will attach it to the currently selected process, presenting a live
update of system calls issued by the process.
.TP
.B l
Display open files for a process: if lsof(1) is installed, pressing this key
will display the list of file descriptors opened by the process.
.TP
.B w
Display the command line of the selected process in a separate screen, wrapped
onto multiple lines as needed.
.TP
.B x
Display the active file locks of the selected process in a separate screen.
.TP
.B F1, h, ?
Go to the help screen
.TP
.B F2, S
Go to the setup screen, where you can configure the meters displayed at the top
of the screen, set various display options, choose among color schemes, and
select which columns are displayed, in which order.
.TP
.B F3, /
Incrementally search the command lines of all the displayed processes. The
currently selected (highlighted) command will update as you type. While in
search mode, pressing F3 will cycle through matching occurrences.
Pressing Shift-F3 will cycle backwards.

Alternatively the search can be started by simply typing the command
you are looking for, although for the first character normal key
bindings take precedence.
.TP
.B F4, \\\\
Incremental process filtering: type in part of a process command line and
only processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel filtering,
enter the Filter option again and press Esc.
The matching is done case-insensitive. Terms are fixed strings (no regex).
You can separate multiple terms with "|".
.TP
.B F5, t
Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the relations
between them as a tree. Toggling the key will switch between tree and
your previously selected sort view. Selecting a sort view will exit
tree view.
.TP
.B F6, <, >
Selects a field for sorting, also accessible through < and >.
The current sort field is indicated by a highlight in the header.
.TP
.B F7, ]

This can only be done by the superuser.
.TP
.B F8, [
Decrease the selected process's priority (add to 'nice' value)
.TP
.B Shift-F7, }
Increase the selected process's autogroup priority (subtract from autogroup 'nice' value).
This can only be done by the superuser.
.TP
.B Shift-F8, {
Decrease the selected process's autogroup priority (add to autogroup 'nice' value)
.TP
.B F9, k
"Kill" process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one or a group
of processes. If processes were tagged, sends the signal to all tagged processes.
If none is tagged, sends to the currently selected process.
.TP
.B F10, q
Quit
.TP
.B I
Invert the sort order: if sort order is increasing, switch to decreasing, and
vice-versa.
.TP
.B +, \-, *
When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree is collapsed
a "+" sign shows to the left of the process name.
Pressing "*" will expand or collapse all children of PIDs without parents, so
typically PID 1 (init) and PID 2 (kthreadd on Linux, if kernel threads are shown).
.TP
.B a (on multiprocessor machines)
Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use.
.TP
.B u
Show only processes owned by a specified user.
.TP
.B N
Sort by PID.
.TP
.B M
Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B P
Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B T
Sort by time (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B F
"Follow" process: if the sort order causes the currently selected process
to move in the list, make the selection bar follow it. This is useful for
monitoring a process: this way, you can keep a process always visible on
screen. When a movement key is used, "follow" loses effect.
.TP
.B K
Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel to be
displayed in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B H
Hide user threads: on systems that represent them differently than ordinary
processes (such as recent NPTL-based systems), this can hide threads from
userspace processes in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B O
Hide containerized processes: prevent processes running in a container
from being displayed in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B p
Show full paths to running programs, where applicable. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B Z
Pause/resume process updates.
.TP
.B m
Merge exe, comm and cmdline, where applicable. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B Ctrl-L
Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.
.TP
.B Numbers
PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight will be moved to it.
.PD
.SH "COLUMNS"
The following columns can display data about each process. A value of '\-' in
all the rows indicates that a column is unsupported on your system, or
currently unimplemented in
.BR htop .
The names below are the ones used in the
"Available Columns" section of the setup screen. If a different name is
shown in
.BR htop 's
main screen, it is shown below in parenthesis.
.TP 5
.B Command
The full command line of the process (i.e. program name and arguments).

If the option 'Merge exe, comm and cmdline in Command' (toggled by the 'm' key)
is active, the executable path (/proc/[pid]/exe) and the command name
(/proc/[pid]/comm) are also shown merged with the command line, if available.

The program basename is highlighted if set in the configuration. Additional
highlighting can be configured for stale executables (cf. EXE column below).
.TP
.B COMM
The command name of the process obtained from /proc/[pid]/comm, if readable.

Requires Linux kernel 2.6.33 or newer.
.TP
.B EXE
The abbreviated basename of the executable of the process, obtained from
/proc/[pid]/exe, if readable. htop is able to read this file on linux for ALL
the processes only if it has the capability CAP_SYS_PTRACE or root privileges.

The basename is marked in red if the executable used to run the process has
been replaced or deleted on disk since the process started. The information is
obtained by processing the contents of /proc/[pid]/exe.

Furthermore the basename is marked in yellow if any library is reported as having
been replaced or deleted on disk since it was last loaded. The information is
obtained by processing the contents of /proc/[pid]/maps.

When deciding the color the replacement of the main executable always takes
precedence over replacement of any other library. If only the memory map indicates
a replacement of the main executable, this will show as if any other library had
been replaced or deleted.

This additional color markup can be configured in the "Display Options" section of
the setup screen.

Displaying EXE requires CAP_SYS_PTRACE and PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCRED.
.TP
.B PID

plus twenty. Different for real-time processes.
.TP
.B NICE (NI)
The nice value of a process, from 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority). A
high value means the process is being nice, letting others have a higher

on. This is sometimes called "Irix mode" e.g. in
.BR top (1).
.TP
.B PERCENT_NORM_CPU (NCPU%)
The percentage of the CPU time that the process is currently using normalized

.TP
.B All other flags
Currently unsupported (always displays '-').
.SH "EXTERNAL LIBRARIES"
While
.B htop
depends on most of the libraries it uses at build time there are two
noteworthy exceptions to this rule. These exceptions both relate to
data displayed in meters displayed in the header of
.B htop
and were intentionally created as optional runtime dependencies instead.
These exceptions are described below:
.TP
.B libsystemd
The bindings for libsystemd are used in the SystemD meter to determine
the number of active services and the overall system state. Looking for
the functions to determine these information at runtime allows for
builds to support these meters without forcing the package manager
to install these libraries on systems that otherwise don't use systemd.

Summary: no build time dependency, optional runtime dependency on
.B libsystemd
via dynamic loading, with
.B systemctl(1)
fallback.
.TP
.B libsensors
The bindings for libsensors are used for the CPU temperature readings
in the CPU usage meters if displaying the temperature is enabled through
the setup screen. In order for
.B htop
to show these temperatures correctly though, a proper configuration
of libsensors through its usual configuration files is assumed and that
all CPU cores correspond to temperature sensors from the
.B coretemp
driver with core 0 corresponding to a sensor labelled "Core 0". The
package temperature may be given as "Package id 0". If missing it is
inferred as the maximum value from the available per-core readings.

Summary: build time dependency on
.B libsensors(3)
C header files, optional runtime dependency on
.B libsensors(3)
via dynamic loading.
.SH "CONFIG FILES"
By default
.B htop
reads its configuration from the XDG-compliant path
.IR ~/.config/htop/htoprc .
The configuration file is overwritten upon clean exit by
.BR htop 's
in-program Setup configuration, so it should not be hand-edited.
If no user configuration exists
.B htop
tries to read the system-wide configuration from
.I @sysconfdir@/htoprc
and as a last resort, falls back to its hard coded defaults.
.LP
You may override the location of the configuration file using the $HTOPRC
environment variable (so you can have multiple configurations for different
machines that share the same home directory, for example).
.LP
The
.B pcp-htop
utility makes use of
.I htoprc
in exactly the same way.
In addition, it supports additional configuration files allowing
new meters and columns to be added to the display via the usual
Setup function, which will display additional Available Meters
and Available Column entries for each runtime configured meter
or column.
.LP
These
.B pcp-htop
configuration files are read once at startup.
The format of these files is described in detail in the
.BR pcp-htop (5)
manual page.
.LP
This functionality makes available many thousands of Performance
Co-Pilot metrics for display by
.BR pcp-htop ,
as well as the ability to display custom metrics added at individual sites.
Applications and services instrumented using the OpenMetrics format
.B https://openmetrics.io
can also be displayed by
.B pcp-htop
if the
.BR pmdaopenmetrics (1)
component is configured.
.LP
The configuration for both
.B htop
and
.B pcp-htop
is only saved when a clean exit is performed. Sending any signal will cause
.I all configuration changes to be lost.
.SH "MEMORY SIZES"
Memory sizes in
.B htop
are displayed in a human-readable form.
Sizes are printed in powers of 1024 using binary IEC units.
If no suffix is shown the units are implicitly K as in KiB (kibibyte, 1 KiB = 1024 bytes).
.LP
The decision to use this convention was made in order to conserve screen
space and make memory size representations consistent throughout
.B htop
as allocations are granular to full memory pages (4 KiB for most platforms).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR proc (5),
.BR top (1),
.BR free (1),
.BR ps (1),
.BR uptime (1)
and
.BR limits.conf (5).
.SH "SEE ALSO FOR PCP"
.BR pmdaopenmetrics (1),
