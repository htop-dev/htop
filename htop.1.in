.B htop 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
This program is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer. 
.LP
It is similar to top, but allows to scroll the list vertically and 
horizontally to see all processes and their full command lines.
.LP
Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without
entering their PIDs.
.br 
.SH "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS"
.LP 
The following flags are supported:
.LP 
.TP
\fB\-d DELAY\fR
Delay between updates, in tenths of seconds
.TP
\fB\-u USERNAME\fR
Show only processes of a given user
.TP
\fB\-\-sort\-key COLUMN\fR
Sort by this column (use --sort-key help for a column list)
.PP
.br 
.SH "INTERACTIVE COMMANDS"
.LP 
The following commands are supported:
.LP 
.TP 5
.B Arrows, PgUP, PgDn, Home, End
Scroll process list.
.TP
.B Space
"Tag": mark a process. Commands that can operate on multiple processes,
like "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged processes, instead
of the currently highlighted one.
.TP
.B U
"Untag" all processes (remove all tags added with the Space key).
.TP
.B s
Trace process system calls: if strace(1) is installed, pressing this key
will attach it to the currently selected process, presenting a live
update of system calls issued by the process.
.TP
.B l
Display open files for a process: if lsof(1) is installed, pressing this key
will display the list of file descriptors opened by the process.
.TP
.B F1, h
Help screen
.TP
.B F2, S
Setup screen. There you can configure meters displayed on the top side
of the screen, as well as set various display options, choose among
color schemes and select the layout of the displayed columns.
.TP
.B F3, /
Incremental process search: type in part of a process command line and
the selection highlight will be moved to it. While in search mode,
pressing this key will cycle through matching occurrences.
.TP
.B F4, \
Incremental process filtering: type in part of a process command line and
only processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel filtering,
enter the Filter option again and press Esc.
.TP
.B I
Invert sort order: if sort order is increasing, switch to decreasing,
and vice-versa.
.TP
.B F5, t
Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the relations
between them as a tree. Toggling the key will switch between tree and
your previously selected sort view. Selecting a sort view will exit
tree view.
.TP
.B F6, >
Select field for sorting. The sort field is indicated by a
highlight in the header.
.TP
.B F7, ], -
Increase selected process priority (subtract from 'nice' value).
This can be done by the superuser only.
.TP
.B F8, [, +
Decrease selected process priority (add to 'nice' value)
.TP
.B F9, k
"Kill" process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one or a group
of processes. If processes were tagged, sends the signal to all tagged processes.
If none is tagged, sends to the currently selected process.
.TP
.B F10, q
Quit
.TP
.B +, - 
When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree is collapsed
a "+" sign shows to the left of the process name.
.TP
.B a (on multiprocessor machines)
Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use.
.TP
.B u
Show only processes owned by a specified user.
.TP
.B M
Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B P
Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B T
Sort by time (top compatibility key).
.TP
.B F
"Follow" process: if the sort order causes the currently selected process
to move in the list, make the selection bar follow it. This is useful for
monitoring a process: this way, you can keep a process always visible on
screen. When a movement key is used, "follow" loses effect.
.TP
.B K
Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel to be
displayed in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B H
Hide user threads: on systems that represent them differently than ordinary
processes (such as recent NPTL-based systems), this can hide threads from
userspace processes in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
.TP
.B Ctrl-L
Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.
.TP
.B Numbers
PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight will be moved to it.
