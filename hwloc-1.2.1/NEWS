Version 1.1.0
-------------

* API
  + Increase HWLOC_API_VERSION to 0x00010100 so that API changes may be
    detected at build-time.
  + Add a memory binding interface.
  + The cpuset API (hwloc/cpuset.h) is now deprecated. It is replaced by
    the bitmap API (hwloc/bitmap.h) which offers the same features with more
    generic names since it applies to CPU sets, node sets and more.
    Backward compatibility with the cpuset API and ABI is still provided but
    it will be removed in a future release.
    Old types (hwloc_cpuset_t, ...) are still available as a way to clarify
    what kind of hwloc_bitmap_t each API function manipulates.
    Upgrading to the new API only requires to replace hwloc_cpuset_ function
    calls with the corresponding hwloc_bitmap_ calls, with the following
    renaming exceptions:
    - hwloc_cpuset_cpu -> hwloc_bitmap_only
    - hwloc_cpuset_all_but_cpu -> hwloc_bitmap_allbut
    - hwloc_cpuset_from_string -> hwloc_bitmap_sscanf
  + Add an `infos' array in each object to store couples of info names and
    values. It enables generic storage of things like the old dmi board infos
    that were previously stored in machine specific attributes.
  + Add linesize cache attribute.
* Features
  + Bitmaps (and thus CPU sets and node sets) are dynamically (re-)allocated,
    the maximal number of CPUs (HWLOC_NBMAXCPUS) has been removed.
  + Improve the distance-based grouping code to better support irregular
    distance matrices.
  + Add support for device-tree to get cache information (useful on Power
    architectures).
* Helpers
  + Add NVIDIA CUDA helpers in cuda.h and cudart.h to ease interoperability
    with CUDA Runtime and Driver APIs.
  + Add Myrinet Express helper in myriexpress.h to ease interoperability.
* Tools
  + lstopo now displays physical/OS indexes by default in graphical mode
    (use -l to switch back to logical indexes). The textual output still uses
    logical by default (use -p to switch to physical indexes).
  + lstopo prefixes logical indexes with `L#' and physical indexes with `P#'.
    Physical indexes are also printed as `P#N' instead of `phys=N' within
    object attributes (in parentheses).
  + Add a legend at the bottom of the lstopo graphical output, use --no-legend
    to remove it.
  + Add hwloc-ps to list process' bindings.
  + Add --membind and --mempolicy options to hwloc-bind.
  + Improve tools command-line options by adding a generic --input option
    (and more) which replaces the old --xml, --synthetic and --fsys-root.
  + Cleanup lstopo output configuration by adding --output-format.
  + Add --intersect in hwloc-calc, and replace --objects with --largest.
  + Add the ability to work on standard input in hwloc-calc.
  + Add --from, --to and --at in hwloc-distrib.
  + Add taskset-specific functions and command-line tools options to
    manipulate CPU set strings in the format of the taskset program.
  + Install hwloc-gather-topology.sh on Linux.


Version 1.0.3
-------------

* Fix support for Linux cpuset when emulated by a cgroup mount point.
* Remove unneeded runtime dependency on libibverbs.so in the library and
  all utils programs.
* Fix hwloc_cpuset_to_linux_libnuma_ulongs in case of non-linear OS-indexes
  for NUMA nodes.
* lstopo now displays physical/OS indexes by default in graphical mode
  (use -l to switch back to logical indexes). The textual output still uses
  logical by default (use -p to switch to physical indexes).


Version 1.0.2
-------------

* Public headers can now be included directly from C++ programs.
* Solaris fix for non-contiguous cpu numbers.  Thanks to Rolf vandeVaart for
  reporting the issue.
* Darwin 10.4 fix.  Thanks to Olivier Cessenat for reporting the issue.
* Revert 1.0.1 patch that ignored sockets with unknown ID values since it
  only slightly helped POWER7 machines with old Linux kernels while it
  prevents recent kernels from getting the complete POWER7 topology.
* Fix hwloc_get_common_ancestor_obj().
* Remove arch-specific bits in public headers.
* Some fixes in the lstopo graphical output.
* Various man page clarifications and minor updates.


Version 1.0.1
-------------

* Various Solaris fixes.  Thanks to Yannick Martin for reporting the issue.
* Fix "non-native" builds on x86 platforms (e.g., when building 32
  bit executables with compilers that natively build 64 bit).
* Ignore sockets with unknown ID values (which fixes issues on POWER7
  machines).  Thanks to Greg Bauer for reporting the issue.
* Various man page clarifications and minor updates.
* Fixed memory leaks in hwloc_setup_group_from_min_distance_clique().

  + Support binding of entire multithreaded process on Linux.
  + Fix and enable Group support in Windows.
  + Cleanup XML export/import.
* Objects
  + HWLOC_OBJ_PROC is renamed into HWLOC_OBJ_PU for "Processing Unit",
    its stringified type name is now "PU".
  + Use new HWLOC_OBJ_GROUP objects instead of MISC when grouping
    objects according to NUMA distances or arbitrary OS aggregation.
  + Rework memory attributes.
  + Add different cpusets in each object to specify processors that
    are offline, unavailable, ...

  + Add hwloc_topology_export_xml() to export the topology in a XML file.
  + Add hwloc_topology_get_support() to retrieve the supported features
    for the current topology context.
  + Support non-SYSTEM object as the root of the tree, use MACHINE in
    most common cases.
  + Add hwloc_get_*cpubind() routines to retrieve the current binding
    of processes and threads.
* API
  + Add HWLOC_API_VERSION to help detect the currently used API version.
  + Add missing ending "e" to *compare* functions.
  + Add several routines to emulate PLPA functions.
  + Rename and rework the cpuset and/or/xor/not/clear operators to output
    their result in a dedicated argument instead of modifying one input.
  + Deprecate hwloc_obj_snprintf() in favor of hwloc_obj_type/attr_snprintf().
  + Clarify the use of parent and ancestor in the API, do not use father.
  + Replace hwloc_get_system_obj() with hwloc_get_root_obj().
  + Return -1 instead of HWLOC_OBJ_TYPE_MAX in the API since the latter
    isn't public.
  + Relax constraints in hwloc_obj_type_of_string().
  + Improve displaying of memory sizes.
  + Add 0x prefix to cpuset strings.
* Tools
  + lstopo now displays logical indexes by default, use --physical to
    revert back to OS/physical indexes.
  + Add colors in the lstopo graphical outputs to distinguish between online,
    offline, reserved, ... objects.
