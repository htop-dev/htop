# This is the VERSION file for hwloc, describing the precise version
# of hwloc in this distribution.  The various components of the version
# number below are combined to form a single version number string.

# major, minor, and release are generally combined in the form
# <major>.<minor>.<release>.  If release is zero, then it is omitted.

major=1
minor=2
release=1

# greek is used for alpha or beta release tags.  If it is non-empty,
# it will be appended to the version number.  It does not have to be
# numeric.  Common examples include a1 (alpha release 1), b1 (beta
# release 1), sc2005 (Super Computing 2005 release).  The only
# requirement is that it must be entirely printable ASCII characters
# and have no white space.

greek=

# If want_repo_rev=1, then the SVN r number will be included in the overall
# hwloc version number in some form.

want_repo_rev=0

# If repo_rev=-1, then the repository version number will be obtained
# dynamically at run time, either: 
#
# 1) via the "svnversion" command (if this is a Subversion checkout)
#    in the form "r<svn_r>", or 
# 2) via the "hg -v -R tip" command (if this is a Mercurial clone)
#    in the form of "hg<hash>", using the hash tag at the tip
# 3) via the "git log -1" command (if this is a Git clone) in the form
#    of "git<hash>", using the hash tag at the HEAD
# 4) with the date (if none of the above work) in the form of
#    "date<date>".
#
# Alternatively, if repo_rev is not -1, the value of repo_rev_r will
# be directly appended to the version string.  This happens during
# "make dist", for example: if the distribution tarball is being made
# from an SVN checkout, if repo_rev=-1, then its value is replaced
# with the output of "svnversion".

# The shared library version of hwloc's public library.  This version
# is maintained in accordance with the "Library Interface Versions"
# chapter from the GNU Libtool documentation.  Notes:

# 1. Since version numbers are associated with *releases*, the version
# number maintained on the hwloc SVN trunk (and developer branches) is
# always 0:0:0.

# 2. Version numbers are described in the Libtool current:revision:age
# format.
