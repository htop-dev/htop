Introduction

hwloc provides command line tools and a C API to obtain the hierarchical map of
key computing elements, such as: NUMA memory nodes, shared caches, processor
sockets, processor cores, and processing units (logical processors or
"threads"). hwloc also gathers various attributes such as cache and memory
information, and is portable across a variety of different operating systems
and platforms.

hwloc primarily aims at helping high-performance computing (HPC) applications,
but is also applicable to any project seeking to exploit code and/or data
locality on modern computing platforms.

Note that the hwloc project represents the merger of the libtopology project
from INRIA and the Portable Linux Processor Affinity (PLPA) sub-project from
Open MPI. Both of these prior projects are now deprecated. The first hwloc
release was essentially a "re-branding" of the libtopology code base, but with
both a few genuinely new features and a few PLPA-like features added in. Prior
releases of hwloc included documentation about switching from PLPA to hwloc;
this documentation has been dropped on the assumption that everyone who was
using PLPA has already switched to hwloc.

hwloc supports the following operating systems:

  * Linux (including old kernels not having sysfs topology information, with
 knowledge of cpusets, offline CPUs, ScaleMP vSMP, and Kerrighed support)
  * Solaris
  * AIX
  * Darwin / OS X
  * FreeBSD and its variants, such as kFreeBSD/GNU
  * OSF/1 (a.k.a., Tru64)
  * HP-UX
  * Microsoft Windows

hwloc only reports the number of processors on unsupported operating systems;
no topology information is available.

For development and debugging purposes, hwloc also offers the ability to work
on "fake" topologies:

  * Symmetrical tree of resources generated from a list of level arities
  * Remote machine simulation through the gathering of Linux sysfs topology
 files

hwloc can display the topology in a human-readable format, either in graphical
mode (X11), or by exporting in one of several different formats, including:
plain text, PDF, PNG, and FIG (see CLI Examples below). Note that some of the
export formats require additional support libraries.

hwloc offers a programming interface for manipulating topologies and objects.
It also brings a powerful CPU bitmap API that is used to describe topology
objects location on physical/logical processors. See the Programming Interface
below. It may also be used to binding applications onto certain cores or memory
nodes. Several utility programs are also provided to ease command-line
manipulation of topology objects, binding of processes, and so on.

Installation

hwloc (http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/) is available under the BSD
license. It is hosted as a sub-project of the overall Open MPI project (http://
www.open-mpi.org/). Note that hwloc does not require any functionality from
Open MPI -- it is a wholly separate (and much smaller!) project and code base.
It just happens to be hosted as part of the overall Open MPI project.

Nightly development snapshots are available on the web site. Additionally, the
code can be directly checked out of Subversion:

shell$ svn checkout http://svn.open-mpi.org/svn/hwloc/trunk hwloc-trunk
shell$ cd hwloc-trunk
shell$ ./autogen.sh

Note that GNU Autoconf >=2.63, Automake >=1.10 and Libtool >=2.2.6 are required
when building from a Subversion checkout.

Installation by itself is the fairly common GNU-based process:

shell$ ./configure --prefix=...
shell$ make
shell$ make install

The hwloc command-line tool "lstopo" produces human-readable topology maps, as
mentioned above. It can also export maps to the "fig" file format. Support for
PDF, Postscript, and PNG exporting is provided if the "Cairo" development
package can be found when hwloc is configured and build. Similarly, lstopo's
XML support requires the libxml2 development package.

CLI Examples

On a 4-socket 2-core machine with hyperthreading, the lstopo tool may show the
following graphical output:

Programming Interface

The basic interface is available in hwloc.h. It essentially offers low-level
routines for advanced programmers that want to manually manipulate objects and
follow links between them. Documentation for everything in hwloc.h are provided
later in this document. Developers should also look at hwloc/helper.h (and also
in this document, which provides good higher-level topology traversal examples.

To precisely define the vocabulary used by hwloc, a Terms and Definitions
section is available and should probably be read first.

Each hwloc object contains a cpuset describing the list of processing units
that it contains. These bitmaps may be used for CPU binding and Memory binding.
hwloc offers an extensive bitmap manipulation interface in hwloc/bitmap.h.

Moreover, hwloc also comes with additional helpers for interoperability with
several commonly used environments. See the Interoperability With Other
Software section for details.

The complete API documentation is available in a full set of HTML pages, man
pages, and self-contained PDF files (formatted for both both US letter and A4
formats) in the source tarball in doc/doxygen-doc/.

NOTE: If you are building the documentation from a Subversion checkout, you
will need to have Doxygen and pdflatex installed -- the documentation will be
built during the normal "make" process. The documentation is installed during
"make install" to $prefix/share/doc/hwloc/ and your systems default man page
tree (under $prefix, of course).

Portability

As shown in CLI Examples, hwloc can obtain information on a wide variety of
hardware topologies. However, some platforms and/or operating system versions
will only report a subset of this information. For example, on an PPC64-based
system with 32 cores (each with 2 hardware threads) running a default
2.6.18-based kernel from RHEL 5.4, hwloc is only able to glean information
about NUMA nodes and processor units (PUs). No information about caches,
sockets, or cores is available.

Similarly, Operating System have varying support for CPU and memory binding,
e.g. while some Operating Systems provide interfaces for all kinds of CPU and
memory bindings, some others provide only interfaces for a limited number of
kinds of CPU and memory binding, and some do not provide any binding interface
at all. Hwloc's binding functions would then simply return the ENOSYS error
(Function not implemented), meaning that the underlying Operating System does
not provide any interface for them. CPU binding and Memory binding provide more
information on which hwloc binding functions should be preferred because
interfaces for them are usually available on the supported Operating Systems.

Here's the graphical output from lstopo on this platform when Simultaneous
Multi-Threading (SMT) is enabled:

ppc64-with-smt.png

And here's the graphical output from lstopo on this platform when SMT is
disabled:

ppc64-without-smt.png

Notice that hwloc only sees half the PUs when SMT is disabled. PU #15, for
example, seems to change location from NUMA node #0 to #1. In reality, no PUs
"moved" -- they were simply re-numbered when hwloc only saw half as many.
Hence, PU #15 in the SMT-disabled picture probably corresponds to PU #30 in the
SMT-enabled picture.

This same "PUs have disappeared" effect can be seen on other platforms -- even
platforms / OSs that provide much more information than the above PPC64 system.
This is an unfortunate side-effect of how operating systems report information
to hwloc.

Note that upgrading the Linux kernel on the same PPC64 system mentioned above
to 2.6.34, hwloc is able to discover all the topology information. The
following picture shows the entire topology layout when SMT is enabled:

ppc64-full-with-smt.png

Developers using the hwloc API or XML output for portable applications should
therefore be extremely careful to not make any assumptions about the structure
of data that is returned. For example, per the above reported PPC topology, it
is not safe to assume that PUs will always be descendants of cores.

Additionally, future hardware may insert new topology elements that are not
available in this version of hwloc. Long-lived applications that are meant to
span multiple different hardware platforms should also be careful about making
structure assumptions. For example, there may someday be an element "lower"
than a PU, or perhaps a new element may exist between a core and a PU.

API Example

The following small C example (named ``hwloc-hello.c'') prints the topology of
the machine and bring the process to the first logical processor of the second
core of the machine.

hwloc provides a pkg-config executable to obtain relevant compiler and linker
flags. For example, it can be used thusly to compile applications that utilize
the hwloc library (assuming GNU Make):

CFLAGS += $(pkg-config --cflags hwloc)
LDLIBS += $(pkg-config --libs hwloc)
cc hwloc-hello.c $(CFLAGS) -o hwloc-hello $(LDLIBS)

On a machine with 4GB of RAM and 2 processor sockets -- each socket of which
has two processing cores -- the output from running hwloc-hello could be
something like the following:

shell$ ./hwloc-hello
*** Objects at level 0
Index 0: Machine(3938MB)
*** Objects at level 1
Index 0: Socket#0
Index 1: Socket#1
*** Objects at level 2
Index 0: Core#0
Index 1: Core#1
Index 2: Core#3
Index 3: Core#2
*** Objects at level 3
Index 0: PU#0
Index 1: PU#1
Index 2: PU#2
Index 3: PU#3
*** Printing overall tree
Machine(3938MB)
  Socket#0
 Core#0
   PU#0
 Core#1
   PU#1
  Socket#1
 Core#3
   PU#2
 Core#2
   PU#3
*** 2 socket(s)
shell$

Questions and Bugs

Questions should be sent to the devel mailing list (http://www.open-mpi.org/
community/lists/hwloc.php). Bug reports should be reported in the tracker (
https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/hwloc/).

If hwloc discovers an incorrect topology for your machine, the very first thing
you should check is to ensure that you have the most recent updates installed
for your operating system. Indeed, most of hwloc topology discovery relies on
hardware information retrieved through the operation system (e.g., via the /sys
virtual filesystem of the Linux kernel). If upgrading your OS or Linux kernel
does not solve your problem, you may also want to ensure that you are running
the most recent version of the BIOS for your machine.

If those things fail, contact us on the mailing list for additional help.
Please attach the output of lstopo after having given the --enable-debug option
to ./configure and rebuilt completely, to get debugging output.

History / Credits

hwloc is the evolution and merger of the libtopology (http://
runtime.bordeaux.inria.fr/libtopology/) project and the Portable Linux
Processor Affinity (PLPA) (http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/plpa/) project.
Because of functional and ideological overlap, these two code bases and ideas
were merged and released under the name "hwloc" as an Open MPI sub-project.

libtopology was initially developed by the INRIA Runtime Team-Project (http://
runtime.bordeaux.inria.fr/) (headed by Raymond Namyst (http://
dept-info.labri.fr/~namyst/). PLPA was initially developed by the Open MPI
development team as a sub-project. Both are now deprecated in favor of hwloc,
which is distributed as an Open MPI sub-project.
